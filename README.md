## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Here are some ideas to get you started:

I am an aspiring data scientist who recently graduated with a Masterâ€™s in Data Science. With a strong enthusiasm for machine learning, deep learning, and building innovative, data-driven solutions, I am always seeking opportunities to grow and collaborate.

My academic journey, especially my thesis work, sparked a particular interest in time series forecasting using Transformer-based models. I'm eager to further explore this field and apply these methods to real-world problems.

Iâ€™m currently looking to contribute to impactful projects where I can apply my skills, expand my expertise, and work collaboratively to develop effective data strategies and solutions.
